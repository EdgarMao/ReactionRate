'''Hey! This is a Edgar Mao's high school Chemistry/Physics project. 
This program simulates the reaction of a given amount of particles in a confined space with given volume.
The programmer identifies the molecules as small particles, the reaction will happen when a particle of reactant A collides with a particle of reactant B with enough momentum.
Collison, in this case, is defined as the distance between two partcles being smaller than an arbitrary parameter.
The program then calculates the instantaneous rates of the whole reaction and plots them into a graph of reaction rate in relationship to time.'''
